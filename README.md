Things we liked/learned:
-I learned how to use nextjs with the react framework to create the frontend design of websites, it turned out to be easy to understand
-Using the chatgpt api was interesting and fairly straightforward, allowing tailoring of the queries we needed was intuitive

Things we didn't like/wanted to learn:
-I didn't like having to set up all of the permissions for the google oath api, I didn't set the correct ones at first so it took up some time to figure out
-Using firebase to deploy our website proved to be very confusing, which is why we opted to use vercel to deploy instead

# Technical Requirements
-Rest API Integration
-User login with Oath login API
-Beautification
-React frontend
